# Task

Building a Full-Stack Link-Sharing ApplicationTask OverviewYour challenge is to build out a link-sharing application and ensure it matches the provided design as closely as possible. You can use Next.js and TS to complete this challenge. The objective is to deliver a pixel-perfect implementation based on the design specifications.Deliverables:

## Feature Implementation

* Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) links with previews.
* Implement form validations for links (ensuring URL correctness) and profile details (ensuring first and last names are provided).
* Allow users to add profile details such as profile picture, first name, last name, and email.
* Enable previewing the devlinks profile and copying the link to the clipboard.
* Ensure optimal layout and responsiveness for different device screen sizes.
* Implement hover and focus states for all interactive elements.
* Ensure only the logged in - owner of the created link has edit access (Back to Editor button should not be visible for other users)

## Full-Stack Application

* Save details to a database using tools like Firebase, Supabase, or similar.
* Implement user authentication, allowing users to create accounts and log in.

### Technology Requirements

* Use Next.js and TypeScript for building the application.
* Follow the design system for colors, fonts, and optimized image assets.
Steps to Complete the Task:

### Design and Layout

* Follow the provided Figma design closely.
* Implement mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts.
* Ensure pixel-perfect implementation.

Feature Development:

### Links Management

* Implement CRUD operations for links.
* Add form validations for URLs.

### Profile Management

* Implement fields for profile picture, first name, last name, and email.
* Add form validations for profile details.

### Profile Preview

* Allow users to preview their profile and copy the profile link.
* Responsive Design:
* Ensure the application is responsive across different devices.

### Full-Stack Integration

#### Database

* Save link and profile details to a database (e.g., Firebase, Supabase).

#### User Authentication

* Implement account creation and login functionalities.

#### Testing and Validation

* Ensure all features are thoroughly tested.
* Validate form inputs and user interactions.
* Test the application across different devices and screen sizes.

#### Evaluation Criteria

##### Completeness

* Are all required features implemented and functional?
* Does the application handle all necessary states and validations?

##### Quality

* Is the design visually appealing and consistent with the Figma design?
* Does the application perform well across different devices and browsers?

##### Functionality

* Are CRUD operations for links and profile management working correctly?
* Are user authentication and database integration properly implemented?
